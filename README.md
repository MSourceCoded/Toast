Toast

**An expansive Minecraft Modding API to rule them all!**

Welcome to 'Toast', a library for Minecraft Mods designed to provide shortcuts and more efficient methods for all aspects of the game.

Toast is maintained mostly by myself, SourceCoded, but is open to contribution from others through Pull Requests. 

##Contact / Inquiries
If you require help, most contributers will be in the #SourceCoded channel in the irc.esper.net channel. Else, submit an issue, or PM us through other means. If you need help, you can join the IRC channel to get help from others, or submit an issue with the "help wanted" label.

##Contributions
If you wish to contribute to 'Toast', either as a fix or a feature addition/removal, please submit a Pull Request with a descriptive comment about what you are PR'ing. Make sure the code is properly documented and **actually works**

It is also recommended that you join the '#SourceCoded' channel on irc.esper.net channel, so we can contact you easily.

####Requirements for Contributions:
**Bugfixes**
  * A description of the bug being fixed
  * The code you have hotfixed doesn't conflict with other code  

**Feature Additions**
  * A description of the feature being added and how it works (be descriptive)
  * Documented functions/fields with the standard JavaDoc syntax
  * An 'author' field at the header of each class (credit yourself!)  

**Feature Removals**
  * A description of the feature being removed and why (chances are if the feature is there, it is meant to be)
  * Proof that the API would be better off without it
  * Suggested replacement methods

**Suggestions**
  * Submit suggestions as an issue with the label 'suggestion' (the yellow one)
  * Make suggestions as detailed as you can. If you don't know much about modding, don't worry, we will try our hardest to understand what you are pitching.
  * If a suggestion is declined, it will have the 'declined' label (orange). If the suggestion is declined and the issue is kept open, keep in mind it will still be taken into consideration perhaps at a later date. If we declare the suggestion as declined forever, the issue will be marked as closed.
  * Accepted suggestions will be marked as closed through a commit message, 'resolving' the issue.

*if you submit a contribution and it is evident you did not read this section of the readme, we will most likely reply with 'RTFM' (read the f---ing manual) and close the issue*  

##Issue Reporting
  * Check if the issue has been reported before. If the issue has already been reported, but perhaps with a different method, submit the error anyway, it will be marked as a duplicate and we will try and fix them.
  * INCLUDE THE VERSION. Always include the version you are using, e.g. "toast-1.7.10-0.0.1a-UNIVERSAL" would be sufficient. If you are instead building from the Source (compiling the github repo), include the commit and branch you built from. We DON'T want to fix bugs that have already been fixed.
  * Provide any and all crash logs/error codes you can. Crash reports help us so much in fixing bugs. It is recommended you submit these in a pastebin/gist.
  * Include Configuration Data (if you can). If you can, try to include your Config files in the bug report. This helps us in reproducing it.
  * Steps to reproduce. Include how you came across the bug or crash. This helps us track down common problems.
  * Dependant Mod Data. Considering Toast is an API, if you can include data about other mods installed that rely on toast, that will help us greatly.
  * If you can, use OpenEye by OpenMods. It automatically collects crash data and snooper settings so we can track down the issues easily. Don't worry, it doesn't bite.
  * Don't submit it if it involves OptiFine. It will be removed immediately.

##Localization
**or 'localisation', however you want to spell it**  
If you wish to submit a contribution to a .lang file, you can do it in one of two ways, as a Pull Request, or opening an Issue. Pull requests are preferrable, however you can submit an issue if the change is minor. Mark these under the 'l18n' label, coloured light green. Localization changes are verified by Google Translate and by others who speak the same language, so merging them can take a small while. All Internationalization/Localization contributions are greatly appreciated.  

##Downloading and Distribution
The Toast API is provided under the MIT license, meaning that you are free to do as you like with the library. Feel free to take the parts of the code that you need, or just depend on the entire library, but we would appreciate it if you cite this repository and it's contributers both in the code's JavaDoc comments and in the mcmod.info file.  

Downloads are yet to be released, for now, you may build from the source.

#####Thank you for using Toast!
